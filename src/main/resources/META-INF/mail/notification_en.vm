Hello,
<p>
    The publication of $path in $language started on $beginDate
    #if ($result == 'error')
        was not executed.
    #elseif ($result == 'nothingToPublish')
        was not executed because all the contents were already published.
    #elseif ($result == 'success')
        was successfully completed on $endDate.
    #else
        [$result]
    #end
</p>
<p>
    #if ($conflictSize > 0)
        The following contents has the same path as the following nodes already exist in live:
        <ul>
            #foreach ($entry in $conflict)
                <li>- $entry</li>
            #end
        </ul>
    #end
</p>
<p>
    #if ($missingPropertySize > 0)
        The following contents are missing mandatory properties:
        <ul>
            #foreach ($entry in $missingProperty)
                <li>- $entry</li>
            #end
        </ul>
    #end
</p>

Thank you
